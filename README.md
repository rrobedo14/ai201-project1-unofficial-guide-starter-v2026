# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

     I picked the campus life corpus because it provides practical, everyday information that makes navigating university life much easier. The system answers questions about campus dining hours, pricing, and locations, such as finding the closest dining hall to the library. Ultimately, it helps students optimize their schedules and budgets while getting around campus efficiently.

    



## Chunking Strategy



<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.
 
     Milestone 3.-->

     **Chunk size: 700**
     **Overlap: 50**

     I initially set a much larger chunk size of 2000 with zero overlap, thinking that keeping massive blocks would preserve as much context as possible. However, after looking at the actual campus life documents, I realized that swallowed multiple distinct topics (like mixing dining hall hours with building locations) into a single block. 

     I experimented with smaller fractional splits next, but they frequently chopped sentences in half. Settling on a chunk size of 700 with a 50-character overlap hit the sweet spot: it kept individual schedule or dining descriptions coherent and self-contained, while the small overlap ensured smooth continuity across chunk boundaries.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

======================================================================
Chunk 1  |  source: admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.

======================================================================
Chunk 2  |  source: course_biol_160.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
BIOL 160 Cell Biology

I lived here my sophomore year. Format is lecture three times a week with a weekly lab. Assessment: four unit tests and a cumulative final. Not curved.

Expect 9 to 11 hours a week, the heaviest first-year course by reputation.

The one piece of advice: the unit tests come fast, roughly every three weeks; falling behind once is very hard to recover from.

======================================================================
Chunk 3  |  source: course_hist_118_workload.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Workload for HIST 118 Modern World History

People keep asking so: a lot of reading, about 120 pages a week, but no problem sets. That's real time, not optimistic time.

It's front-loaded — the first month is heavier than the rest, partly because you're learning the format.

======================================================================

======================================================================
Re: Pellew Dining Hall

Adding to what people have said about Pellew Dining Hall. The wait figure of 12 to 18 minutes at peak matches what I've seen. If you're trying to eat between classes, go before 11:45 and it's a different building entirely.

Also worth saying: the furthest hall from anywhere, next to the athletics centre. Nobody tells you this at orientation.

======================================================================
Chunk 5  |  source: housing_innisfree_hall.txt#0  |  produced by: chunker.py::split_documents
======================================================================
Innisfree Hall — what it's actually like

Transferred in last year, so take this with a grain of salt. Built 1991, renovated 2022. Rooms are doubles arranged as pairs sharing one bathroom between two rooms.

The good: the shared-bathroom-between-two-rooms arrangement is the best compromise on campus.

The bad: no air conditioning, which matters for the first three weeks of September.

Laundry costs $1.75 wash, $1.75 dry, app-based. On noise: moderate; the building is L-shaped and the short wing is much quieter.

Halden Hall

I lived here my sophomore year. Wait times: rarely more than 8 minutes, even at noon. The thing worth going for is soup rotation, and thebread is baked on site. The thing to know is that closes at 7:00pm, which catches people out.

Hours are 7:30am to 7:00pm weekdays, closed Sundays. Costs one meal swipe, or $10.00 cash.

Pellew Dining Hall

Second-year here. Wait times: 12 to 18 minutes at peak, and the peak is early — 11:45 to 12:30. The thing worth going for is a dedicated allergen-free station staffed by someone who knows the menu. The thing to know is that the furthest hall from anywhere, next to the athletics centre.

Hours are 7:00am to 8:00pm daily. Costs one meal swipe, or $11.75 cash.

Adding to what people have said about North Kitchen. The wait figure of none matches what I've seen. If you're trying to eat between classes, go before 11:45 and it's a different building entirely.

Also worth saying: closed all summer and during reading week. Nobody tells you this at orientation.

Question: When is the best time to visit the dining hall?

Answer using only the documents above, and name the file you used.
======================================================================

To avoid the peak wait times between classes, it is recommended to go before 11:45 (`dining_pellew_dining_hall_followup.txt`, `dining_halden_hall_followup.txt`, and `dining_north_kitchen_followup.txt`).

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it. 
     Milestone 5. -->


**1.**
     "I asked Claude to evalute my chunking function I selected size of 800 and
     overlap of 100. Claude suggested that the overlap was too big and as a result my second
     chunk would be a copy of the first"

**2.**
     "I asked Claude to help me debug an error I keep getting: KeyError: '_type'. This was the solution: corrupted-cache situation " — python -c "import store; store.reset()" then re-index.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
